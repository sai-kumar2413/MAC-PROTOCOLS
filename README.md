# MAC-PROTOCOLS
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF S-MAC  AND IEEE 802.11 PROTOCOLS IN  WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS

# Abstract
To evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.11 & S-MAC protocols by varying different parameters. The comparison between IEEE 802.11 and S-MAC is carried out with the help of AWK file which is an Interpreted Programming Language. The simulation results and the performance metrics using plots and graphs are analysed.Compared in terms of throuput,packet delivery ratio (PDR), Packet drop count, Energy consumption 

# MAC Protocols
A MAC protocol decides when competing nodes could access the shared medium and tries to ensure that no collisions occur while nodes transmission
Current MAC protocols design for wireless sensor network can be broadly divided into schedule-based and contention-based protocol.
Schedule-based MAC protocols include TDMA, FDMA and CDMA.
Contention-based MAC protocols include IEEE 802.11(CSMA/CA), S-MAC, T-MAC are categorized into contention-based MAC protocols.

In this project our focus is only on IEEE 802.11 and Sensor-MAC(SMAC) protocols. Hence,simulations have been conducted to show the performance of these MAC protocols under different scenarios.
